### Branching Strategy

#### Working with Local Repos

Development work will be done on feature branches off of the main branch. The naming convention we will use for naming feature branches is the last name/family name of the developer.

The following commands can be used when working with repos locally (i.e., on your machine).

Clone the repo locally:

```console

git clone https://github.com/BUMETCS673/project-team-4.git

``````

Create a feature branch from main:

```console

git checkout -b last_name

```

Switch between branches:

```console

git checkout branch_name

```

Commit and push changes to the remote repo:

```console

git add -A
git commit -m "my commit message"
git push origin last_name

```

View local and remote branches:

```console

git branch -a

```

Check the status of the current branch:

```console

git status

```
